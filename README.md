# GaussianNaiveBayes
Implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in the scikit-learn framework and explore how missing values can be handled in supervised machine learning. Two strategies will be explored:

(1) consider missing values explicitly in the classification algorithm (Gaussian Naive Bayes) 

(2) use imputation methods to guess missing values
